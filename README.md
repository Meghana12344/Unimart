# Unimart
Overview:
Unimart is a peer-to-peer marketplace built specifically for college campuses, where students can buy, sell, or lend items like furniture, clothes, and school supplies. At schools like UCSC, many upperclassmen are left with beds, sofas, and other essentials they no longer need when moving out of unfurnished apartments. At the same time, underclassmen are often in search of affordable ways to furnish their new living spaces.

Unimart connects these two groups, making it easy for students to exchange what they no longer need with others who doâ€”saving money, reducing waste, and making campus life more convenient. By giving everyday items a second life, the platform promotes environmental sustainability while strengthening the student community through localized, university-specific networks.

Whether you're moving in or moving on, Unimart makes it easy to pass it forward.
